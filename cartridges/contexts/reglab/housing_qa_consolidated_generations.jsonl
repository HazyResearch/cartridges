The tenant must provide advance written notice to the landlord stating:a. The tenant fears imminent domestic violence from a person named in a court order, protection order under section 14-07.1-02, ex parte temporary protection order, order prohibiting contact, restraining order, or other record filed with a court;b. The tenant needs to terminate the tenancy; andc. The specific date the tenancy will terminate.3. The notice must be delivered by mail, facsimile communication, or in person before the termination of the tenancy.4. A landlord may not disclose information provided to the landlord by a tenant documenting domestic violence under this section. The information may not be entered into any shared database or provided to any person, but may be used as evidence in an eviction proceeding, in a claim for unpaid rent or damages arising out of the tenancy, or as otherwise required by law.5. A tenant terminating a lease under this section is responsible for the rent payment for the full month in which the tenancy terminates and an additional amount equal to one month's rent, subject to the landlord's duty to mitigate. The tenant is relieved of any other contractual obligation for payment of rent or any other charges for the remaining term of the lease, except as provided in this section.6. This section does not affect a tenant's liability for delinquent, unpaid rent, or other amounts owed to the landlord before the lease was terminated by the tenant under this section.7. The tenancy terminates, including the right of possession of the premises, on the termination date stated in the notice under subsection 2. The amount equal to one month's rent must be paid on or before the termination of the tenancy for the tenant to be relieved of the contractual obligations for the remaining term of the lease as provided in this section.8. For purposes of this section, timing for the payment of the lessee's security deposit under section 47-16-07.1 is triggered by either of the following:a. If the only tenant, including the tenant's minor children, is the tenant who is the victim of domestic violence, upon the first day of the month following the date the tenant vacates the premises.b. If there are additional tenants bound by the lease, upon the expiration of the lease.9. Notwithstanding the release of a tenant from a lease agreement under this section, the tenancy continues for any remaining tenants.10. A person may not refuse to rent, refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or in any other manner make unavailable or deny a dwelling to an individual, or otherwise retaliate in the rental of a dwelling solely because a tenant or applicant or a household member of the tenant or applicant exercised the right to terminate a lease under this section.11. In an action for a violation of this section, the court may award statutory damages of one thousand dollars. The court also may award actual damages, reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and disbursements."]]}

The tenant should have received this notice before this lawsuit was filed or with the summons.\nRent cases. If this lawsuit has been filed for not paying rent, the tenant can stop it and continue living in the residence by paying all rent now due, late fees, attorney's fees and court costs. After a judgment has been granted, reinstatement of the lease is solely in the landlord's discretion. Inability to pay rent is not a legal defense and the judge cannot give more time to pay, even if the tenant is having financial problems.\nAt Court. At the time and date listed on the summons, the judge will start calling cases. If both parties are present, the judge will ask the tenant whether the complaint is true. If the tenant says \u201cno\u201d, he or she will need to briefly tell the judge why. If the reason is a legal defense, the judge will need to hear testimony from both sides and make a decision after a trial. After talking to the landlord or its attorney, a tenant may wish to agree to what the landlord is requesting by signing a \u201cstipulation\u201d. A stipulation is an agreement under which the parties resolve the dispute on the basis of what the agreement says. Only matters contained in the written agreement can be enforced. These agreements should be clear and understandable by both parties. Most stipulations include judgments tenants.\nContinuances. Either party may ask that the court date be delayed. The court will agree only if there is a very good reason. A delay will be no more than three business days. There is no assurance a delay will be granted and parties should come to court prepared for trial and bring necessary witnesses and documents.\nAfter a Judgment. If a landlord receives a judgment, it may apply for a writ of restitution to remove the tenant(s) and all occupants. Writs of Restitution are served by constables, who will direct the residents to leave. A tenant may avoid the difficulties associated with a writ of restitution by vacating the property and returning the keys to the landlord. This ends the tenants' possession of the residence. A tenant will have five (5) days to vacate the premises unless the court has found a material and irreparable breach of the lease by the tenant, in which case the tenant has only twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) hours to vacate. A judgment will probably appear on a tenant's credit report for several years. Parties wishing to appeal from a judgment have five days to do so after the judgment is entered and can obtain forms and information from the court filing counter. If a tenant wants to remain in the rental home during the appeal, the tenant must also pay an appropriate bond and continue to pay rent into court as it becomes due. If the tenant prevails the court will dismiss the case. Absent an appeal, the tenant will need to obtain the landlord's approval and enter a new lease to continue living in the residence.\nSources of Additional Information.

These subjects will thereafter be considered part of the appeal if covered in the brief of appellant or cross-appellant. If no appeal is pending, a postjudgment order awarding or denying costs, attorney\u2019s fees, prejudgment interest, or restitution may be considered a final judgment subject to an appeal limited to issues of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, prejudgment interest, or restitution. Any subsequent appeals of this order allowed under paragraph (a)(2) of this rule also will be limited to issues of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, prejudgment interest, or restitution unless the period for filing a notice of appeal on the underlying judgment has not yet expired.

and,WHEREAS, COVID-19 can spread among people through respiratory transmissions, asymptomatic people can transmit the virus, and there is currently no effective treatment or vaccine; and,WHEREAS, for the preservation of public health and safety throughout the entire State of Illinois, and to ensure that our healthcare delivery system is capable of serving those who are sick, I have found it necessary to take additional measures consistent with public health guidance to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19; and,WHEREAS, COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic impact, including loss of income and wages, that threatens to undermine the financial security of many Illinoisans; and,WHEREAS, residential eviction actions are governed by Article IX of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 ILCS 5/9-101 et seq.; and,WHEREAS, in the midst of the ongoing public health crisis, residential evictions are contrary to the interest of preserving public health by ensuring that individuals remain in their homes as much as possible; and,WHEREAS, public health guidance advises that minimizing physical interactions between people who do not reside in the same household is critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19; and,WHEREAS, access to housing helps prevent spread of COVID-19 because individuals with housing are able to minimize physical contact with those outside their households; and,WHEREAS, temporarily halting eviction proceedings avoids numerous interactions associated with being evicted, including with law enforcement officers, courtroom personnel, landlords, movers, and friends and family who must agree to provide temporary housing, as well as, for those who are forced into homelessness, the interactions associated with seeking and taking refuge in a shelter; and,WHEREAS, preventing spread by temporarily halting eviction proceedings thus also prevents spread of COVID-19 in the broader community; and,WHEREAS, on March 20, 2020, I issued Executive Order 2020-10, in which I ordered all state, county, and local law enforcement officers to cease from enforcing eviction orders for residential properties; and,WHEREAS, on April 23, 2020, I issued Executive Order 2020-30, in part, because the ongoing public health emergency required further action to prevent the commencement of residential eviction proceedings; and,WHEREAS, on April 30, 2020, I issued Executive Order 2020-33, which amended Executive Order 2020-30, to continue the prohibition on enforcement of residential eviction actions; and,WHEREAS, the prohibitions on commencement of residential eviction actions and the enforcement of residential eviction orders in Executive Order 2020-33 have been extended by subsequent Executive Orders; and,WHEREAS, on November 13, 2020, considering the continuing, and, in fact, increasing spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing health and economic impacts that that will be felt over the coming month by people across the State, I declared all counties in the State of Illinois as a disaster area; and,WHEREAS, the number of new COVID-19 cases in the State has surged over the past several weeks, and the virus continues to infect thousands of individuals and claim the lives of too many Illinoisans each day; and,WHEREAS, the State and the Illinois Department of Public Health have developed a mitigation plan to trigger additional precautions when regions meet certain risk levels; and,WHEREAS, as of November 13, 2020, all regions of the State have triggered these additional mitigation strategies; and,WHEREAS, while the precautions taken by Illinoisans previously slowed the growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the State, the number of cases in the State is now again growing exponentially; and,WHEREAS, recognizing the continued need for action to prevent the spread of COVID-19, this Executive Order extends the prohibition on the commencement and enforcement of evictions with additional safeguards intended to balance the rights of tenants and landlords throughout the State;THEREFORE, by the powers vested in me as the Governor of the State of Illinois, pursuant to the Illinois Constitution and Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(8), 7(10), and 7(12) of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 20 ILCS 3305, and consistent with the powers set forth in the State\u2019s public health laws, I hereby order the following, effective November 13, 2020:Section 1.

Each landlord, owner of a residential property, or other person or entity with a legal right to pursue an eviction or possessory action must provide each tenant, lessee, sub-lessee, and resident with a Declaration prior to commencement of any residential eviction proceeding including, but not limited to, prior to the issuance of a notice of termination of tenancy.\u201cNon-Discretionary Expenses\u201d include, but are not limited to, food, utilities, phone and internet access, school supplies, cold-weather clothing, medical expenses, child care, and transportation costs, including car payments and insurance.Section 2. A person or entity may not commence a residential eviction action pursuant to or arising under 735 ILCS 5/9-101 et seq. against a Covered Person unless that person poses a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property.Section 3. All state, county, and local law enforcement officers in the State of Illinois are instructed to cease enforcement of orders of eviction for residential premises, unless the tenant, lessee, sub-lessee, or resident of the residential property has been found to pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other tenants or an immediate and severe risk to property.Section 4. Nothing in this Executive Order shall be construed as relieving any individual of the obligation to pay rent or comply with any other obligation that an individual may have pursuant to a lease or rental agreement.Section 5.

If such breach can be remedied by repair by the resident or payment of damages by the resident to the owner and such breach is not so remedied within twenty-one days, the rental agreement shall terminate except that (A) if the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages and the resident adequately remedies the breach within said twenty-one-day period, the rental agreement shall not terminate, or (B) if substantially the same act or omission for which notice was given recurs within six months, the owner may terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the provisions of sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b, inclusive. For the purposes of this subdivision, \u201cserious nuisance\u201d means (i) inflicting bodily harm upon another resident or the owner or threatening to inflict such harm with the present ability to effect the harm and under circumstances which would lead a reasonable person to believe that such threat will be carried out, (ii) substantial and wilful destruction of part of the premises, (iii) conduct which presents an immediate and serious danger to the safety of other residents or the owner, or (iv) using the premises for prostitution or the illegal sale of drugs. If the owner elects to evict based upon an allegation, pursuant to subdivision (8) of subsection (b) of section 21-82, that the resident failed to require other persons on the premises with the resident's consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not constitute a serious nuisance, and the resident claims to have had no knowledge of such conduct, then, if the owner establishes that the premises have been used for the illegal sale of drugs, the burden shall be on the resident to show that the resident had no knowledge of the creation of the serious nuisance.\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-23, termination of any tenancy in a mobile manufactured home park shall be effective only if made in the following manner:\n(A) By the resident giving at least thirty days' notice to the owner;\n(B) By the owner giving the resident at least sixty days' written notice, which shall state the reason or reasons for such termination, except that, when termination is based upon subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the owner need give the resident only thirty days' written notice, which notice shall state the total arrearage due provided, the owner shall not maintain or proceed with a summary process action against a resident who tenders the total arrearage due to the owner within such thirty days and who has not so tendered an arrearage under this subparagraph during the preceding twelve months.\n(4) Except as otherwise specified, proceedings under this section shall be as prescribed by chapter 832.\n(5) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an owner from increasing the rent at the termination of the rental agreement if (A) the owner delivers a written notice of the proposed rent increase to the resident at least thirty days before the start of a new rental agreement; (B) the proposed rent is consistent with rents for comparable lots in the same park; and (C) the rent is not increased in order to defeat the purpose of this subsection.\n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36, if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a mobile manufactured home owner and resident based upon subparagraph (D) of subdivision (1) of subsection (b) of this section, execution shall not issue until six months from the date of such judgment. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the mobile manufactured home owner and resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such mobile manufactured home owner and resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other sum as is reasonable.\n(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 47a-35 and 47a-36, if judgment is entered in a summary process action against a resident who owns the mobile manufactured home, the resident may, prior to the expiration of the automatic stay of execution provided in section 47a-35 or 47a-36, as applicable, move for permission to exercise in good faith the resident's right to sell the mobile manufactured home in place in the mobile manufactured home park, subject to the provisions of section 21-79, and the court may stay execution upon such judgment pending sale of the home. Such stay may be ordered for a period or periods in an aggregate not to exceed twelve months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action, except that any such stay or stays extending beyond six months from the date of the judgment in the summary process action shall be reviewed every two months to determine that the resident is making a good faith effort to sell the home. The court shall condition such stay of execution upon a requirement that the resident make payments to the plaintiff in the summary process action in such installments as the court may direct for the use and occupancy of the premises during the period of such stay at the rate for which such resident was most recently liable as rent or in such other amount as is reasonable and may, in addition, impose other reasonable terms and conditions on the stay. If there is a rental arrearage at the time of the entry of the order, the court shall order that it be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, except that the court, upon finding that the resident has the present ability to pay the arrearage, may require that all or part of such arrearage be paid as a condition of the stay.\n(e) (1) If (A) a judgment for possession has been entered against the resident and all occupants of a mobile manufactured home pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; (B) no rent or other payment has been received for the use and occupancy of the lot upon which the mobile manufactured home is situated for at least four months; (C) at least sixty days have passed since the expiration of the last stay of execution pursuant to chapter 832 and this section; and (D) notwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-42, the mobile manufactured home remains upon the lot, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park may initiate a petition to the Superior Court pursuant to this section. Such petition may be brought as a supplemental proceeding in the summary process action, in which case no additional entry fee shall be required.\n(2) The petition shall allege the acts specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection and, in addition, shall allege supporting facts which demonstrate that the owner of the mobile manufactured home has failed or refused to make reasonable efforts to remove the home from the lot or to sell the home in place or that, in spite of reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home or such owner's representative, the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has been unable to locate such owner. Reasonable efforts to locate the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable inquiry of relatives or associates of the owner of the home, if known to the owner of the park, and of other residents of the park.\n(3) A copy of the petition and the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given to the owner of the mobile manufactured home, the municipality and all lienholders who have recorded a lien against the mobile manufactured home or of whom the owner of the mobile manufactured home park has actual knowledge. Notice to the municipality and to lienholders shall be by certified mail. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be designed to maximize the likelihood that the owner will receive actual notice of the petition, without regard to whether the owner appeared in the summary process action. Such notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be conspicuously posted at the entrance to the mobile manufactured home and also sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the mobile manufactured home and to the attorney, if any, who appeared for such owner in the summary process action. Notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home shall be sent to such owner at the owner's last-known address and also to such owner in care of any other person reasonably believed to know the location of the owner. The court may require supplemental notice if it finds that additional notice is likely to result in actual notice to the owner of the mobile manufactured home.\n(4) At the hearing on the petition, the court shall determine whether all the requirements of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection have been satisfied and, if they have, shall also determine whether the home has been abandoned. If such requirements have been satisfied and such home has been abandoned, the court shall order the owner of the mobile manufactured home park to conduct a public sale of the home. Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from deferring the entry of an order requiring sale and from issuing other appropriate orders, if the court finds that, within a reasonable period of time, the owner of the mobile manufactured home will remove the home from the lot or dispose of the home by sale or will make other appropriate arrangements with the park owner. The order directing sale shall require notice which includes a conspicuous statement that the sale will extinguish all previous ownership and lien rights. Notice shall be given by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to all persons entitled to notice of the petition. Notice shall also be posted conspicuously at the entrance of the home and shall be advertised at least three times in the real estate section of a daily paper with general circulation in the area where the park is situated. Any person, including a lienholder or the owner of the mobile manufactured home park, may bid at the sale. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied first to the costs of the sale and then to the payment of lienholders in the order of the priority of their liens. If proceeds remain thereafter they shall be paid over to the owner of the mobile manufactured home. Upon conclusion of the sale, the park owner shall file an affidavit with the court setting forth the nature of its compliance with the court's order of sale. The court, upon finding compliance with its order, shall issue a conveyance of title and release of liens, if any, to the purchaser for filing in the land records, which shall constitute good title to the home, and no execution shall issue on the original summary process action."]]}

Violation by a tenant or the tenant's cohabitees, guests or invitees of paragraph A, B or E, 3 or more times in a 12-month period, notwithstanding the fact that the tenant in each case corrected the violation after being notified of the violation by the park owner or operator. For purposes of termination under this paragraph, the tenant or the tenant's cohabitees, guests or invitees must have engaged in at least 3 separate instances of misconduct.   \n1-A.  Retaliation.  The court may not order the termination of any tenancy if the tenant proves that the eviction action is primarily in retaliation for:  \nA. The tenant's participation in establishing, or membership in, an organization concerned with landlord-tenant relationships; or   \nB. The tenant's assertion of any right under this chapter.   \n1-B.  Abandoned mobile home or manufactured housing.  Manufactured housing that is abandoned or unclaimed by a tenant following the tenant's eviction in accordance with this section and section 9097-B must be disposed of by a mobile home park owner or operator as follows. For purposes of this subsection, \"manufactured housing\" includes all housing described in section 9002, subsection 7 located in a land lease community or mobile home park.  \nA. After a mobile home park owner or operator obtains a judgment for forcible entry and detainer, the mobile home park owner or operator shall send written notice by first-class mail, with proof of mailing, to the last known address of the tenant with a copy to the lienholder, if known. The notice must set forth the mobile home park owner's or operator's intent to dispose of the manufactured housing. The notice must advise the tenant and lienholder, if known, that if the tenant or lienholder does not respond to the notice within 14 calendar days the mobile home park owner or operator may dispose of the property as set forth in this subsection. If the tenant or lienholder does respond to the notice, the tenant or lienholder shall take possession of the property within 21 calendar days. Subsection 2-B applies with respect to the rights and responsibilities of the lienholder.  \nB. If a tenant or lienholder claims ownership of the manufactured housing within 14 calendar days after the notice under paragraph A is sent, the tenant or lienholder shall take possession of the property within 21 calendar days of claiming ownership. If the tenant or lienholder timely claims the property but is not able to move the property within 21 days due to weather or posted road conditions, the mobile home park owner or operator shall allow the tenant or lienholder to remove the property after the 21-day period but the mobile home park owner or operator may charge for any additional costs incurred as a result of the delay.  \nC. If a tenant or lienholder does not claim ownership of the property within 14 calendar days after the notice under paragraph A is sent or fails to take possession of the property after claiming ownership pursuant to paragraph B, the mobile home park owner or operator may take one or more of the following actions:  \n(1) Condition the release of the property to the tenant or lienholder upon payment of all rental arrearages, damages, costs of legal fees and costs of storage;  \n(2) Sell any property for a reasonable fair market price and apply all proceeds to rental arrearages, damages, costs of storage, marketing expenses, legal fees and outstanding taxes. Any balance must be sent to the tenant's or lienholder's last known mailing address and, if returned to the sender, the balance must be forwarded to the Treasurer of State; and  \n(3) Dispose of any property that has no reasonable fair market value.  \n2.  Notice.  A tenancy in a mobile home park may be terminated only by:  \nA. The tenant giving at least 45 days' notice of termination to the park owner; or  \nB. The park owner entitled under subsection 1 to the mobile home space giving at least 45 days' notice of termination in writing to the tenant. If the landlord or the landlord's agent has made at least 3 witnessed good faith efforts made on 3 separate days to serve the tenant, service may be accomplished by both mailing the notice by first class mail to the tenant's last known address and by leaving the notice at the tenant's space in the park.  \n(1) In cases where the reason for eviction is nonpayment of rent, the tenancy may be terminated by 30 days' notice given in the same manner provided that the notice for eviction contains notice of the amount owed and a statement indicating that the tenant can negate the effect of the notice of termination as it applies to rent arrearage if the tenant pays the full amount of rent due before the expiration of the notice.  \n(2) In cases in which the reason for eviction is one listed in subsection 1, paragraph B, C, D, E, H or I, the 45 days' notice of termination must refer to relevant provisions of the lease or mobile home park rules and must state the reasons for the termination.  \n2-A.  Notice to lienholders. Repealed.\n2-B.  Responsibilities of park operator and lienholder.  The responsibilities of the mobile home park operator and the holder of a lien on the tenant's mobile home are as follows.  \nA. In the event the park operator moves to evict a tenant and there is a lien on the tenant's home, if the holder of the lien has provided the park operator with a notice of the lien and the notice includes the lienholder's mailing address, then prior to evicting the tenant who resides in that mobile home, the park operator shall give notice of the eviction in writing by certified mail to the lienholder at the time the park operator serves the tenant with a notice to quit. Following receipt of this notice from the park operator, the lienholder shall:  (1) Declare, in writing and by certified mail, to the park operator that the lienholder intends to take possession of the mobile home and assume tenancy in the park. The lienholder shall pay to the park operator:  \n(a) Any arrearage for rent and other recurring monthly fees owed the park operator by the tenant at the time of issuance of the notice to quit;  \n(b) Rent and other charges that become due subsequent to issuance of the notice to quit. Rent and charges imposed pursuant to this division may not exceed 3 months of those rents and charges; and  \n(c) Rent and other charges that become due subsequent to the issuance of a forcible entry and detainer or, if no forcible entry and detainer is issued, following abandonment by the tenant or possession of the home by the lienholder; or  \n(2) Declare, in writing and by certified mail, to the park operator that the lienholder intends to take possession of the mobile home but not assume tenancy in the park. The lienholder also shall:  \n(a) Pay to the park operator any arrearage for rent and other recurring monthly fees owed the park operator by the tenant at the time of issuance of the notice to quit; and  \n(b) Remove the mobile home from the mobile home park.  \nThe arrearage for which the lienholder is responsible may not exceed 3 months rent and recurring fees.   \nB. In the event that the holder of a lien on a mobile home in a mobile home park intends to repossess that home, the holder of the lien shall provide the park operator with a notice that it holds a lien, which notice must include the lienholder's mailing address and shall:  \n(1) Give notice in writing and by certified mail to the park operator of the lienholder's intent to repossess and that the lienholder intends to leave the mobile home in the park and assume tenancy in the park. The lienholder also shall pay to the park operator any arrearage for rent and other recurring monthly fees owed the park operator by the tenant at the time it takes possession of the mobile home and all rent and other charges that become due subsequent to the time it takes possession of the mobile home; or  \n(2) Give notice in writing and by certified mail to the park operator of the lienholder's intent to repossess and that it does not intend to leave the mobile home nor assume tenancy in the park. The lienholder also shall pay to the park operator any arrearage for rent and other recurring monthly fees owed the park operator by the tenant at the time it takes possession of the mobile home and all rent and other charges that become due subsequent to the time it takes possession of the mobile home until the lienholder physically removes the mobile home from the park.  \nThe arrearage for which the lienholder is responsible may not exceed 3 months rent and other recurring fees.   \nNotwithstanding this subsection, the lienholder and the park operator may agree to an alternative arrangement if they so choose.  \n3.  Fees.  The owner of a mobile home park or the owner's agents may not charge any fees to tenants other than charges for rent, utilities, reasonable incidental service charges, entrance fees or security deposits, unless otherwise provided for in the original lease or agreement. The owner of a mobile home park or the owner's agents may not charge any entrance fee, regardless of what that fee is called, to a tenant who is moving into a mobile home currently in the mobile home park that is greater than 2 times the amount of the monthly rent.  \n4.  Rules.  A mobile home park owner may adopt reasonable rules governing the conduct of tenants, if the rules are reasonably related to preserving the order and peace of other tenants and the mobile home park. A park rule may not be unreasonable, unfair or unconscionable. Any rule or change in rent that does not apply uniformly to all park tenants creates a rebuttable presumption that the rule or change in rent is unfair unless the rule or change in rent is made by majority vote of all the members in a resident-owned cooperative. Any park rule that does not comply with this section is void. For purposes of this subsection, \"resident-owned cooperative\" means a corporation or other legal entity that owns the mobile home park, the ownership interest in which is held only by residents of the mobile home park.  \n5.  Tenant to be given copy of rules and applicable laws.  Before any rental agreement is entered into, the owner must provide each tenant who resides in the park and all prospective tenants with:  \nA. A written copy of the rules of the mobile home park; and   \nB. A written copy of this chapter.   \n6.  Enforcement.  In addition to any other remedy under this chapter, any mobile home park resident may sue to enforce any provision of this section and the court may award damages or grant injunctive or other appropriate relief.  \n7.  Waiver prohibited.  No lease or rental agreement, oral or written, may contain any provision by which the tenant waives any rights under this chapter. Any such waiver is contrary to public policy and unenforceable.  \n8.  Written or oral rental agreement.  Nothing in this section may be construed to permit a park owner or operator to vary the terms of a written or oral rental agreement without the express written consent of the tenant.  \n9.  Rental agreements involving children. \n10.  Discrimination against tenants with children prohibited.  Discrimination against any tenant with children is prohibited in accordance with Title 5, chapter 337.  \n11.  Breach of warranty of habitability as an affirmative defense.  In an action brought by a mobile home park owner to terminate a rental agreement on the ground that the tenant is in arrears in the payment of rent, the tenant may raise, as a defense, any alleged violation of the implied warranty and covenant of habitability provided that:  \nA. The tenant gave the mobile home park owner, or the owner's agent has received, actual notice of the alleged violation while the tenant was current in rental payments;   \nB. The park owner or operator unreasonably failed under the circumstances to take prompt, effective steps to repair or remedy the condition; and \nC. The condition was not caused by the tenant or another person acting under the tenant's control.  \nUpon finding that the leased premises is not fit for human habitation, the court shall permit the tenant either to terminate the rental agreement without prejudice or to reaffirm the rental agreement and the court shall assess against the tenant an amount equal to the reduced fair rental value of the property for the period during which rent is owed. The reduced amount of rent owed is to be paid on a pro rata basis, unless the parties agree otherwise, and payments are due at the same intervals as rent for the current rental period. The mobile home park owner may not charge the tenant for the full rental value of the property until the property is fit for human habitation.  \n12.  Application; mobile homes owned by park.  If a park owner or operator owns a mobile home in the mobile home park and rents that mobile home, termination of the tenancy is governed by the terms of the lease. If there is no lease agreement, the tenancy is a tenancy at will and termination is governed by Title 14, section 6002.  "]]}

The bond on appeal shall have sufficient surety and shall be conditioned to secure the payment of costs if the appeal is dismissed or the judgment affirmed, or such costs as the supreme court may award if the judgment is modified. If a bond on appeal in the sum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) is given, no approval thereof is necessary. After a bond on appeal is filed, an appellee may by motion raise objection to the form or amount of the bond or to the sufficiency of the surety, which shall be determined by the appellate court. In lieu of filing such cost bond, the appellant may deposit in the office of the clerk of the appellate courts a sum of money reasonably sufficient to cover such costs, the amount thereof to be fixed by the appellate court. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a bond for costs on appeal shall not be required in an appeal from a decision of the trial court in any criminal case or any civil case where an indigent party is entitled to court-appointed counsel, and a bond shall not be required from an employee appealing from a denial of compensation by the Alaska Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Commission or from a denial of a claim for benefits under AS 23.20 (Employment Security Act). (d) Supersedeas Bond. Whenever in a civil case an appellant entitled thereto desires a stay on appeal, the appellant may present to the superior court for its approval a supersedeas bond which shall have such surety or sureties as the court requires. The bond shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the judgment in full, together with costs and interest, if for any reason the appeal is dismissed or if the judgment is affirmed, and to satisfy in full such modification of the judgment and such costs and interest as the supreme court may adjudge and award. When the judgment is for the recovery of money not otherwise secured, the amount of the bond shall be fixed at such sum as will cover the whole amount of the judgment remaining unsatisfied, costs on the appeal, and interest, unless the superior court, after notice and hearing and for good cause shown, fixes a different amount or orders security other than the bond. When the judgment determines the disposition of the property in controversy as in real actions, replevin, and actions to foreclose mortgages or when such property is in the custody of the court or the state troopers or when the proceeds of such property of a bond for its value is in the custody or control of the court, the amount of the supersedeas bond shall be fixed at such sum only as will secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of the property, the cost of the action, costs on appeal, and interest, unless the superior court, after notice and hearing and for good cause shown, fixes a different amount or orders security other than the bond. The state or an officer or agency thereof or a municipality or an officer or agency thereof desiring a stay on appeal is exempted from the requirement of posting supersedeas bond imposed by this subsection. (e) Statement of Points. At the time of filing the notice of appeal, the appellant shall serve and file a concise statement of the points on which appellant intends to rely in the appeal. The appellate court will consider only points included in the statement, and points that the court can address effectively without reviewing untranscribed portions of the electronic record. On motion in the appellate court, and for cause, the statement of points may be supplemented. (f) Judgment Against Surety. By entering into an appeal or supersedeas bond given pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of this rule, the surety submits to the jurisdiction of the superior court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of that court as the surety\u2019s agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety\u2019s liability on the bond may be served. The surety\u2019s liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the superior court prescribed may be served on the clerk of the superior court who shall forthwith mail copies to the surety if the surety\u2019s address is known. (g) Parties to the Appeal. All parties to the trial court proceeding when the final order or judgment was entered are parties to the appeal. A party who files a notice of appeal, whether separately or jointly, is an appellant under these rules. All other parties are deemed to be appellees, regardless of their status in the trial court, unless otherwise ordered by the court. An appellee may elect at any time not to participate in the appeal by filing and serving a notice of non-participation. The filing of a notice of non-participation shall not affect whether the party is bound by the decision on appeal. (h) Service of Documents. Papers filed or served in the appeal must be served on all parties, except appellees who have elected not to participate in the action. (i) Joint or Consolidated Appeals. If two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment or order of a court and their interests are such as to make joinder practical, they may file a joint notice of appeal. Appeals may be consolidated by order of the appellate court upon its own motion or upon motion of a party."]]}

The burden shall be on the party seeking approval of a supersedeas bond in an amount less than the full judgment together with interest and trial costs or a form of security other than a supersedeas bond either in the full judgment amount or an amount less than the full judgment together with interest and trial costs to show that the posting of a supersedeas bond in the full judgment amount would cause undue economic hardship and that in the circumstances such lesser amount or other form of security is adequate and just.

(3) When the judgment determines the disposition of the property in controversy or when such property is in the custody of the sheriff or when the proceeds of such property or a bond for its value is in the custody or control of the court below, the amount of the supersedeas bond shall be fixed at such sum only as will secure the damages recovered for the use and detention of the property, trial and appellate costs, and interest. (4) In all other cases not specifically provided for herein the amount of the supersedeas bond shall be fixed by the court. (b) Appellants Excepted. When an appeal is taken or certification sought by the State or any political subdivision thereof or any of their respective officers or agencies or by direction of any of the principal departments of the State and the operation or enforcement of a judgment or order is stayed, no bond, obligation or other security shall be required from the appellant.

The court for good cause shown may allow the posting of a supersedeas bond or other form of security in lieu of the cash deposit.
